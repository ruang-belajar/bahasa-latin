## Word Order
The words in a Latin sentence are not usually in the same order as they would be in an English sentence. For example, sum nauta and nauta sum mean the same thing. This may seem strange to you at first, but it will become easier with practice.

EXERCISES:
1. *Sum nauta.*
2. *Nauta sum*

## NEW WORD: *ego*

*Sum* means _I am_ by itself. However, *ego* may also be used with sum. Whether you say *sum* or *ego sum*, it still just means _I am._ *Ego* is often used for emphasis.

Remember: The words in a Latin sentence may be in an unusual order.

EXERCISES:
1. *Sum*.
2. *Ego sum*.
3. *Sum nauta*.
4. *Nauta sum*.
5. *Ego sum nauta*.
6. *Ego nauta sum*.
7. *Nauta ego sum*.

## NEW WORD: *agricola*
MEANING _farmer_

EXERCISES:
1. *Sum agricola.*
2. *Agricola sum.*
3. *Ego sum agricola.*
4. *Ego agricola sum.*
5. *Sum nauta.*
6. *Nauta sum.*
7. *Ego nauta sum.*
8. *Nauta ego sum.*

## NEW WORD: *et*
MEANING _and_
Most of the time, et simply means and. But, if you use it twice, it can mean both...and. Here is an example:
*Sum et nauta et agricola* (_I am both a sailor and a farmer_).

EXERCISES:
1. *Nauta et agricola*
2. *Agricola et nauta*
3. *Ego sum nauta.*
4. *Nauta sum.*
5. *Et agricola et nauta sum.*
6. *Ego sum et nauta et agricola.*

## NEW WORD: *nōn*
MEANING _not_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: In both classical and ecclesiastical pronunciation, *nōn* rhymes with bone, loan and tone.

In a sentence, *nōn* usually comes immediately before the verb. For example, *nōn* sum means I am not.

EXERCISES:
1. *Nōn sum.*
2. *Ego nōn sum.*
3. *Nōn sum nauta.*
4. *Nauta nōn sum.*
5. *Ego agricola nōn sum.*
6. *Agricola ego nōn sum.*
7. *Sum et nauta et agricola.*
8. *Et agricola et nauta ego sum.*

## NEW WORD: *es*
MEANING _you are_
In English, it takes two words to say _you are_. In Latin, it takes only one: es*.

*Es* is used only when speaking to one person.

EXERCISES:
1. *Es.*
2. *Nōn es.*
3. *Es agricola.*
4. *Agricola es.*
5. *Nōn es agricola.*
6. *Agricola nōn es.*
7. *Sum agricola.*
8. *Ego nōn sum nauta.*
9. *Es et nauta et agricola.*
10. *Nauta sum et agricola es.*

## NEW WORD: *est*
MEANING _he is_

In English, it takes two words to say _he is_. In Latin, it takes only one: *est*. *Est*
can also mean _she is_ and _it is_, but for now just translate est as _he is_.
EXERCISES:
1. *Est poēta.*
2. *Poēta est.*
3. *Est nauta.*
4. *Nauta est.*
5. *Nōn est agricola.*
6. *Nōn es nauta.*
7. *Agricola nōn es.*
8. *Ego nōn sum.*
9. *Et agricola et poēta sum.*
10. *Ego nauta nōn sum.*

Let’s learn another way to use *est*. Sometimes *est* simply means is. Consider the following example:

*Poēta est agricola.*

This sentence means the _poet_ is a _farmer_. Here, it is clear that *poēta* is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we leave out _he_ and *est* simply means _is_.

In other cases, there is no other word to be the subject of the sentence, as in the following example:

*Poēta est.*

This sentence means _he is a poet_. Here it is clear that there is no other word available to be the subject of the sentence. So, we translate est as _he is_. 

If you cannot figure out whether *est* means _is_ or _he is_, try them both. The correct meaning of est should become clear.

EXERCISES:
1. *Agricola est poēta.*
2. *Nauta est poēta.*
3. *Est nauta.*
4. *Poēta nōn est nauta.*
5. *Nauta nōn est.*
6. *Poēta est agricola.*
7. *Nauta nōn est agricola.*

## NEW WORD: *sumus*
MEANING _we are_

When studying any language it is important to notice whether each individual word is singular or plural. Why? Because each word in a sentence must interact correctly with the words around it. In grammatical terms, this is
called agreement. See if you can figure out what is wrong with the following example:

*Sum agricolae.*

Did you notice something strange about that sentence? This sentence does not make any sense because it means I am farmers. In other words, *sum* and *agricolae* do not agree because *sum* is singular and *agricolae* is plural. A correct sentence would be *sum agricola* because *sum* and *agricola* agree. Again, see if you can figure out what is wrong with the following example:

*Sumus agricola.*

This sentence does not make any sense either because it means _we are a farmer_. *Sumus* and *agricola* do not agree because *sumus* is plural and *agricola* is singular. A correct sentence would be *sumus agricolae* because *sumus* and *agricolae* agree.

If you get stuck, check the answers in the back of the book.

EXERCISES:
1. *Sumus.*
2. *Sumus nautae.*
3. *Nautae sumus.*
4. *Agricolae nōn sumus.*
5. *Nōn sumus agricolae.*
6. *Sumus agricolae et poētae.*
7. *Poēta nōn es.*
8. *Ego sum poēta.*
9. *Poēta est nauta.*
10. *Nauta est.*

## NEW WORD: *sunt*
MEANING _they are_

*Sunt* is very similar to *est*. *Sunt* can mean _they are_ or just _are_. Consider the
following example:

*Agricolae sunt poētae.*

This sentence means the _farmers are poets_. Here it is clear that *agricolae* is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we leave out they and sunt simply means _are_.

In other cases, there is no other word to be the subject of the sentence, as in the following example:

*Poētae sunt.*

This sentence means _they are_ poets. Here there is no other word available to be the subject of the sentence. So, we translate sunt as they are.

Again (just as with *est*), if you cannot figure out whether *sunt* means _are_ or
_they are_, try them both. The correct meaning of *sunt* should become clear.

EXERCISES:
1. *Poētae sunt.*
2. *Poētae sunt agricolae.*
3. *Agricolae nōn sunt.*
4. *Poētae sunt nautae.5. Poēta est.*
6. *Estis poētae.*
7. *Nautae nōn sunt agricolae.*
8. *Agricola est poēta.*
9. *Nautae sumus.*
10. *Nōn es poēta*

## PERSON

We have already covered singular and plural. Now let’s talk about another quality that verbs have. In Latin, verbs tell not only what action is taking place, but also who is performing the action. Verbs can be in the first person, second person, or third person.

Verbs that refer to I or we are first person (the person who is speaking).

Verbs that refer to you, either singular or plural, are second person (the person or people to whom the speaker is speaking). In this book we will use y'all for the second person plural to help distinguish it from the second person singular.

Verbs that refer to he, she, it, or they are third person (the person, thing, people, or things being spoken about).

The following chart should help illustrate this concept

| | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person| I | we |
| 2nd person | you | you all |
| 3rd person | he, she, it | they |

If we put all the Latin verbs you know in a chart like the one above, it would look like this:

| | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person| sum | sumus |
| 2nd person | es | estis |
| 3rd person | est | sunt |

Remember to chant or sing these verbs over and over in order to memorize them.

In the exercises below, determine what the subject of each sentence is. Then, determine if it is first person, second person, or third person. Finally, determine whether it is singular or plural.

EXERCISES:
1. I am hungry.
2. You are a nice person.
3. She is very smart.
4. We are going to the park.
5. Y'all have a beautiful home.
6. They eat lunch at Aunt Martha’s house every Sunday.
7. He is a tennis player.
8. It is a history book.
9. Y'all really know how to throw a party.
10. The flowers in your garden are pretty.

## DIRECT OBJECTS
When *nauta* is the subject of a sentence it appears in its normal form which is *nauta*. When *nauta* is the direct object in a sentence, we change the ending to *-am*. That makes it *nautam* instead of nauta. Use *nautam* only with action verbs, not verbs of being or existing like _am_, _are_, or _is_ (also called
linking verbs). A word that renames the subject of the sentence after a linking verb is called a predicate nominative. Predicate nominatives take the normal form of the word, not the direct object form. Here are some examples to help illustrate these concepts:

_The *nauta* saw an island._

In this sentence, sailor is the subject of the sentence, so it retains its normal form which is nauta. Here is another example:

_I saw a *nautam*._

In this sentence, sailor is the direct object, so the ending changes to *-am* to make *nautam*. Here is a third example:

_The man is a *nauta*._

In this sentence, sailor is the predicate nominative (a word that renames the subject of the sentence after a linking verb) so it retains its normal form which is *nauta*.

In the exercises below, fill in the blank with either *nauta* or *nautam*. Then, give the reason for your choice. Choose from among the following three reasons:

* Because it is the subject of the sentence
* Because it is the direct object of the sentence
* Because it is a predicate nominative

Write your answers in your notebook or on a separate sheet of paper.

EXERCISES:
1. Yesterday, I saw a ________ down at the dock.
2. I am a ________.
3. A ________ steered the ship into the harbor.
4. I hired a ________ to help us steer the boat.
5. A ________ walked toward the ship.
6. The ________ is very strong.
7. I watched the ________ as he lowered the anchor.
8. He is a ________.
9. You helped the ________ with the rope.
10. I will be a ________ someday

## NEW WORD: *spectō*
MEANING _I watch, I do watch, I am watching_

*Spectō* is our first action verb in Latin. It means _I watch, I do watch_, or _I am
watching_. You can use words such as *ego* and *nōn* along with *spectō*, just as you would with *sum*.

In the last lesson, we learned that if *nauta* is a direct object, the ending changes to *-am*. This rule is also true for *agricola* and *poēta*. *Agricola* becomes *agricolam* and *poēta* becomes *poētam*. Keep this in mind as you translate the exercises into English. Don’t let the order of the words confuse you. Instead, just focus on the function of each individual word.

Since *spectō* can mean _I watch, I do watch_, or _I am watching_, you must decide on your own which one sounds best when you translate the exercises into English.

EXERCISES:
1. *Spectō nautam.*
2. *Nautam spectō.*
3. *Nōn spectō agricolam.*
4. *Agricolam spectō.*
5. *Spectō poētam.*
6. *Poētam spectō.*
7. *Ego spectō et nautam et agricolam.*
8. *Nauta nōn sum.*
9. *Agricolae sunt.*
10. *Poētae nōn estis.*
